# Change Log

* Consolidated Named & FluentName update mod.rs.
* Adding validation of the FluentName String to alphanumeric or hyphens.
* Updating dependency version numbers to only use MAJOR and MINOR and not PATCH to avoid having to constantly update.
* Adding log warning to when FluentName defaults to blank bacause of bad name.
* I love the `thiserror` crate.
